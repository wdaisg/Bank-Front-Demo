# Bank Command Line Interface Demo

This Web Application was developed in `Java spring boot as backend` and `React as frontend` to simulate interaction with a retail bank. Implemented the following CLI commands:

| Command                           | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| login `<client>`                  | Login as `client`. Creates a new client if not yet exists`   |
| topup `<amount>`                  | Increase logged-in client balance by `amount`.               |
| pay `<another_client>` `<amount>` | Pay `amount` from logged-in client to `another_client`, maybe in parts, as soon as possible. |
